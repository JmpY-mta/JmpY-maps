# JmpY-maps
This repository contains MTA:SA maps I made. All maps contained in this repository are covered under the [GPL-2.0 license](https://github.com/JmpY-mta/JmpY-maps/blob/main/LICENSE). Please review the terms when making any alterations to any of the maps.

## Installing maps
To load the maps in your map editor, you can manually download any map directory, and store it in:
`./MTA San Andreas 1.6/server/mods/deathmatch/resources/`

Or you can update the entire repository through [git](https://git-scm.com/):
1. clone the repository in `./MTA San Andreas 1.6/server/mods/deathmatch/resources/`.
2. Rename the created `JmpY-maps` directory to `[JmpY-maps]`.
3. MTA will now automatically load maps from the `[JmpY-maps]` directory.
4. You can pull in any updates from the repository by simply running `git pull` from the `./MTA San Andreas 1.6/server/mods/deathmatch/resources/[JmpY-maps]/` directory.

## Collaboration
If you'd like to propose any change to any map, please submit a Pull Request (PR), with your proposed change. You may add your name / MTA alias to the author section in the meta.xml file. I.e. `author=JmpY` to `author="JmpY, <name>"` [example](https://github.com/JmpY-mta/JmpY-maps/blob/main/DD-JmpY-One/meta.xml#L3)). And bump up the version number of the map, ideally following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
